### Secreto

This is an application where you can view local tourist spots that might not be that well known
and get information about them.

Made with React Native, Redux, and Firebase

The app has a login and register. Once the user has successfully logged in you will be directed to the browse
page where you can see all the other users' spots that they have submitted.
The "Locations" section on the menu is for all the locations that a user has submitted. Other users can then see
it once it has been uploaded. The user can add a location with an image, location info, and optionally coordinates
on a map.
Users can comment and like different locations.

The "Destinations" section on the menu is for the spots that a user wanted to save because they like it
and may want to visit it in the future. The submitter can't save their own location as a destination.

There is a search section for specific searches, and a logout button.
The application has integration with google maps so that users can see where
areas are on a map.
